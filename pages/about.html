      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <!-- <p>
        The best employees are the ones with a passion for their work.
      </p> -->
      <p>
        I am a self-taught software developer looking forward to channeling my passion into a career in the field. Being inclined to all things tech, in addition to my curiosity about how the future of music, art, and AI will intersect, propels me to keep exploring this field further. I have now accumulated a wide range of web development skills, and I believe my broad skillset and driven personality will enable me to excel at a job in this area.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a intuitive problem solver, I see each technical challenge as a learning opportunity. My self-teaching skills are well-honed by years of independent study, enabling me to tackle new problems head-on and uncover solutions in a timely manner. I am not easily overwhelmed by crises. Rather, I approach issues in a level-headed manner, coming up with a reasonable game plan and figuring out the best solution for each situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        My ambitious, goal-oriented nature enables me to set high standards and maintain them. However, I am a strong believer that no human being is perfect on their own; I invite critique and utilize feedback to make improvements. I have learned that teamwork is especially essential in the field of technology, where a fresh pair of eyes can shed light on many of the commonly overlooked issues, bugs, and errors.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tech industry is an ever-evolving world, where it’s essential to keep up to date with new developments. My love of learning makes me well-suited to this scenario, and I look forward to using my skills to help businesses advance.
